# Mario Bros made in Unity
To play, simply download the Super Mario Bros in Unity.exe file and
open it! Right now, only level 1-1 is playable.
Controls are arrow keys to move, space bar to jump, 'X' to run, and 'T' to shoot a fire ball.
Incomplete aspects include: No music or sound effects, fireball physics are not quite the same
as the original, flagpole animation is incomplete, bricks do not break as big Mario, enemies are
not defeated by jumping and hitting the brick block that they are on, the star animation is not
the same, nothing pauses when Mario gets a power up, and there is no UI yet.
